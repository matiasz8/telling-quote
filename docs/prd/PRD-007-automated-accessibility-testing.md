# PRD-007: Automated Accessibility Testing & Validation

**Status**: 📝 Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Phase**: 2.0 - Quality Assurance  
**Owner**: QA Lead / Accessibility Champion  
**Created**: January 9, 2026  
**Last Updated**: January 9, 2026

---

## Overview

Implement comprehensive automated accessibility testing to ensure tellingQuote maintains WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as development continues. This includes automated axe testing, screen reader compatibility validation, and continuous integration checks. Builds on PRD-004 (Accessibility Features) to validate and prevent regression.

---

## Problem Statement

While PRD-004 implements accessibility features, we lack:

1. **No automated regression testing** - Manual testing catches bugs post-release only
2. **Screen reader compatibility unknown** - Only designed for SR, not tested with real readers
3. **WCAG compliance verification missing** - No automated checks against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria
4. **CI/CD pipeline lacks a11y gates** - Code merges without accessibility validation
5. **Team doesn't know current state** - No accessibility audit report or metrics
6. **Inaccessible changes slip through** - No barrier preventing regression

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

- Implement automated axe-core testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Create screen reader validation suite (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Generate accessibility audit reports
- Prevent WCAG AA regression with automated gates

### Secondary Goals

- Establish accessibility baseline metrics
- Train team on automated a11y testing
- Create accessibility testing documentation
- Establish accessibility testing standards

### Success Metrics

- 100% of PR changes run through axe testing
- 0 accessibility regressions in 6 months
- 95%+ of WCAG 2.1 AA criteria automated coverage
- All pages tested with 2+ screen readers
- < 2 violations per automated test run

---

## User Stories

**As a developer**  
I want automated a11y checks on every PR  
So that I don't accidentally make the app less accessible

**As a QA engineer**  
I want to run accessibility tests locally before committing  
So that I can catch and fix issues early

**As a product manager**  
I want an accessibility audit report  
So that I can demonstrate WCAG compliance to stakeholders

**As an accessibility champion**  
I want a continuous baseline of a11y metrics  
So that I can track improvements over time

**As an end user with disabilities**  
I want confidence the app works with my screen reader  
So that I can trust the accessibility isn't just theoretical

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|

| Too many false positives | High | Tune rules, document overrides |
| Tests slow down CI/CD | High | Run in parallel, optimize |
| Developers ignore a11y warnings | High | Merge gates (block on violations) |
| Screen readers change behavior | Medium | Regular testing, monitor releases |
| Automated tests miss real issues | Medium | Supplement with manual testing |
| Team doesn't know how to fix violations | High | Documentation + training sessions |
| Report generation fails | Low | Fallback to manual report |
