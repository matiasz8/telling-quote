# This workflow is disabled by default because the app uses dynamic routes
# that require server-side rendering or generateStaticParams().
# 
# Since data is stored in localStorage, static generation is not suitable.
# For deployment, use Vercel which supports SSR out of the box.
#
# To enable this workflow, uncomment the 'on' section below and ensure
# you've added generateStaticParams() to all dynamic routes.
